# Data for replication

Here is the data needed for replicating the experiments. 

1. The file [d_insample.xlsx](data/d_insample.xlsx) contains 20 demand samples, where each sample is randomly generated from a truncated normal distribution N(20, 15^2) on \[0, 40\]. 
2. The file [d_outsample.xlsx](data/d_outsample.xlsx) contains 2000 demand samples, where each sample is randomly generated from a truncated normal distribution N(20, 15^2) on \[0, 40\]. 
3. The file [distance.xlsx](data/distance.xlsx) contains the distance matrix, where the location of each store is randomly picked from a 10 by 10 grid.
